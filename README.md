This repository contains code that implements algorithms and models from Sutton's book on reinforcement learning. The book, titled "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction," is a classic text on the subject and provides a comprehensive introduction to the field.

The code in this repository is organized into several modules, each of which covers a different topic from the book. For example, there are modules for dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal difference learning.

While the code in this repository provides a basic implementation of the algorithms from the book, it is not necessarily the most efficient or well-written code. If you have suggestions for improving the code, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

In addition to the code, this repository also contains Jupyter notebooks that provide examples of how to use the implemented algorithms and models. These notebooks can be used as a guide for understanding the concepts from the book and for applying the code to solve real-world reinforcement learning problems.

Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about reinforcement learning and implementing algorithms from Sutton's book.
